    <ul><li><h3><u> Power and High Speed 32-bit ALU</u> :</h3></ul></li>
    <p>Designed a 32-bit ALU supporting arithmetic, logical, and shift operations using Verilog/SystemVerilog, following
optimized RTL design for low power and high-speed performance.Conducted RTL simulation and verification using ModelSim and performed synthesis, implementation, and timing analysis using Xilinx Vivado

<ul><li><h3><b><u>Vehicle to vehicle communication (V2V)</u> :</b></h3></ul></li>
<p>Implemented a Li-Fi–based Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication system to transmit real-time speed and location
data and generate obstacle alerts, improving road safety and collision avoidance.Developed and tested the system using Arduino Uno, Li-Fi modules, Ultrasonic sensors, and LDR, with Embedded C programming in the Arduino IDE.

<ul><li><h3><b><u>Smart Irrigation System using IOT</u> :</b></h3></ul></li>
<p>Planned a smart irrigation system simulated in Proteus using Arduino Uno, automating water supply based on soil moisture sensor readings to improve irrigation efficiency.Executed IoT-based monitoring and control using Embedded C in Arduino IDE, simulating sensor data and actuator operation to demonstrate automated irrigation without physical hardware.
